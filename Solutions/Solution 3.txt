The hardest part about this problem is figuring out what the hell the file even is. I'm anticipating we'll have to give out a strong hint on this one, but if they pay attention to the "Intel Briefing" they may figure it out. It's something where it'll be pretty easy once you know what tool to use.

The file is... dun dun dun... a ram/memory capture. I used Moonsols' DumpIt.exe, but others exist. The best way to analyze these is a tool called Volatility, which is on Kali. 

You can't easily get plaintext passwords with a ram capture, but you CAN get the password hashes. To do this we need the system and SAM files, which are available in virtual memory.

In a modern system, this wouldn't be as helpful today, but as you can see by the name of the file, they were running a windows XP system. Windows XP uses LM password hashing for passwords under 14 or so characters, which means it's very very crackable.

Step 1: 

Get the offsets of the SAM/system files, which has the hashes:

You have to specify which type of OS you're working with for it to run. The filename should give this away, and you can guess that it's service pack 3 (or with trial/error). 

Note: Run "volatility --info" to get a list of profile names.

If you look at the System and SAM sections, you'll notice their offset in virtual memory. We'll use this to extract it.

This reveals our hashes, specifically the one for IEUser. Let's crack it! The admin password is actually even easier to crack in this case, but we were asked by our "employers" to get IEUser's password specifically. We'll start doing this with john the ripper:

john IE_hash.txt // contains the entire last line of the above output.

The first part of the hash will take a while with john the ripper (like 30min ish). The second half though will be revealed instantly as ' ! '. Since the intel briefing included says we're under a time constraint, it's our job to crack the first part f the hash as quick as possible - google to the rescue!

Copying the first hash into an online LM cracker will reveal the first half of the password instantly. XP hashes are unsalted, so people have databases of saved hashes they've cracked before online!

Together, they reveal the true password:
